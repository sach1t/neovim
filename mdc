        CASE OF THE MISSING DOUBLE CLICK

        Double clicks are detected in handle_mouse_event: os/input.c                    
        Found by looking where MOD_MASK_2CLICK is set                                   
                                                                                        
        use debug function and we see the time elapsed and that orig_num_clicks         
        stays the same at 1 no matter how fast we are.                                  
                                                                                        
        revert to before that commit that added release event and we see if it          
        was working here.                                                               
                                                                                        
        here it was working, we iterate through 1...4 of clicks and mode                
        changes                                                                         
                                                                                        
        So.... we got an issue after release event was added                            
                                                                                        
        Hypotheses:                                                                     
        1. one of the conditions to increment orig_num_clicks is false                  
        2. the problem is sitting elsewhere                                             
                                                                                        
                                                                                        
        Testing #1                                                                      
        without patch we get 44, 44, 44, 44 mouse code and we go on through             
        with patch we get 44, 46, 44, 46 and so we never pass for                       
        mouse_code == orig_mouse_code                                                   
                                                                                        
        With vim we seem to be throwing the same mouse events 32, 32, 32, 32            
                                                                                        
        maybe in original vim there is a case where we see if we are dealing            
        with a release event and we handle it seperately                                
                                                                                        
        32 in vim seems to be a left button down                                        
                                                                                        
        vim does a 32 on click and a 35 on release                                      
        on click it calls that section of code, then on release we                      
        do nothing                                                                      
                                                                                        
        mouse_code = 32 <- click

        NOW Lets find out where vim ends this line of execution on release              
        so that we dont run the section that processes double clicks on release         
        events...  option is to not store mouse_code on release                         
        but then we would still store the prior times so NO NO NO
